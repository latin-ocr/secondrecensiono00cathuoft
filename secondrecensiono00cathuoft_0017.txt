PREFA CE. xi

Paris with0ut date by Garnier. When the lesson passes from
one chapter to another, there is usually a marginal note to
say that ehap. iii. or chap. xx, (as it may be) begins ; but these
marginal notes have not been reproduced in this reprint.
When a lesson begins at the first verse of a chapter all the
four editionS, as a rule, give a reference to the chapter. R.
and V. give this reference nearly always in the margin, P. and
A. in the text or in the margin, perhaps more often in the
text, and it is placed before Lectio i. or Lectio ij. Such varia-
tions as these have not been noticed.

In like manner the Psalms have not been reprinted3 but
the beginning and end of each have been given. The version
which they follow is that of the Vulgate3 and their number-
ing, it may also be said, is that of the Vulgate, not that of the
HebreWS. The Canticles at LaudS, with Te Deum, Bene-
dictus, Magm'ficat, and Nunc Dimittis, have been printed in
full.

It may be observed that, in accordance with old custom‚
the Venite said at Matins as the Invitatory is of the Italic
Version3 that in the Psalter of the Gallican. It has been
thought best here to note a variation of A. Between the
third and fourth verse of the Venite in the Psalter (p. 7) it
inserts a verse from the Italic: Quoniam non repellet Domi-
nus plebem suam.

It did not seem worth while to give all the variations
of the endings of the collectS. R. and V. usually give the

’ keynote only, per or Qui, while P. and, more rarely, A.

sometimes give the whole of the ending, or the first five
or six words of it. All, however, that V. gives has been
carefully reproduced.

Nor was it thought desirable to represent all the varia-
tions in spelling which the various editions show: in P„
printed in Gothic type, no diphthongs are used3 ‘t’ before
an ‘i' is commonly used where V. reads ‘c' and the like.
And plain misprintS, such as ‘regilione,’ when the other
three editions read ‘ religione,' have not always been recorded.
But on the other hand, definite statements peculiar to the
text have been left untouched3 such as that in the Third
Lesson of S. Thomas of Canterbury‚ where the archbishop is
said to have been murdered v. cal. Decembris, This statement
