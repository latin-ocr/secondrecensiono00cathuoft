PREFACE.

j ‘2⁷³³HE book now presented to liturgical students is a
, 42ss reprint of the first text of the Reformed Breviary
’ ⁷ ’Ἃ of Cardinal Quignon. Copies of this first text are
very rare3 doubt has been even expressed by bibliographers
whether any part of the recension had survived beyond the
few pages of the preface that are preserved in the great
Library at Paris in the Rue de Richelieu.
This text of the Breviary was in use only from February
1535 to July 1536. During this short time there appeared at
least six editions ; to wit:

1. R. (Biblioteca Angelica‚ Rome. Ι. 9. 8.)
Tz'tle .·

Breviarium Romanum Ι ex sacra potissimum Ι Scriptura
et pro Ι batis sancto Ι rum histo Ι riis con Ι stanS. [In red
Roman capitals]

Below this is a Greek cross: in hoc szgrno vinces in red
Roman capitals runs round; and on lowest part of page
is: MDXXXV.

The last page is taken up in great part by a woodcut of
a crowned eagle, the body between the letters A and B : the
claws holding a eloth: above the woodcut is: Non recedat
volumen legis Ι huius ab ore tuo, Ι sed meditaberis in eo
diebus Ι ac noctibus} Below is: Romae apud Antonium
Bla Ι dum asulanum anno domini. Ι M.D.XXXV. Calend.
