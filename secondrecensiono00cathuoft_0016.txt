index with an asterisk. It will be seen at once that whatever
originality there may be in the general scheme of Cardinal
Quignon, yet he has drawn the details almost entirely from
, older sources, The Litany on Ash Wednesday is the same
as that to be found in the same place in the Breviary of 1534,
leaving out the invocation of St Joseph and four or six other
saints, This cannot be said of the Third LessonS. Very·
few of these are even based upon the old Breviary lessons; in
the lives of the Pope5‚ the following of Platina has been
almost servile, even important misprints have been repro-
duced; for example, in the ¹third lesson of Iginius (Jan. 11)
the patrimus of Quignon appears in Platina. And in the
same way many words and phrases have been borrowed from
Rufinus' version of Eusebius, It is a matter of regret that Ι
have not been able to strike the sources of all the Third
LessonS. It would seem certain that with a good library such
an undertaking would be easy. But for reasons which I need
not here explain ever since the book has been in printing I
have been compelled constantly to change my place of dwell-
ing, and I have been often far from all bookS‚ not to say
librarieS. I would ask, therefore, that those who make use of
the book would remember the circumstances under which it
was printed when they discover the faults with which it is
almost sure to abound.

In reprinting this text, the contractions used by the
*printers os the sixteenth century have been expanded to the
best of my ability, taking Chassant's Dz'ctionnaz're des Abre'vz‘a-
tiens as guide. Where the contractioris in V. have been
expanded in any of the other editionS, I have followed as
a rule the contemporary interpretation, even when another
might have seemed a better reading.

The determination of the Syndicate of the University
Press to print only the beginning and end of each lesson from
the Vulgate has spared the reprint a great increase of bulk.
The first and second Iessons for Advent Sunday have been re-
printed in full; but all the others taken from Holy Scripture
are indicated by the* chapter and verse from the Vulgate, given
at the foot of the page. The edition used for this purpose has
been a modern Bz‘blz'a Sacra Vulgatae Edz'tionz's published at
