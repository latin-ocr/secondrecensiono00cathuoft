 

PREFA CE. xiii

collation of the Antwerp edition has been obtained, through
the good offices of Messrs Ellis and Elvey, after I had given
up all hopes of tracing the copy. To the owner of this
edition, the Rev. J. H. Ellis of Stourton, I am under great
Δ obligations for his courtesy and patient kindness in entrust-
ing his precious volume for so many months to the safe
keeping of Mr Blew, for the purpose of so prolonged a
cossafion. ·

Dr Romolo Brigiuti was good enough to read the proofs
with the Roman edition in the Biblioteca Angelica; so that
any variations which might have escaped my collation in
1886 should not slip through this second net. I am also
glad to have this opportunity of thanking Mr W. Bliss for
his kindness in obtaining for me admission to the Vatican
Library during my stay in Rome.

Much help has been given me by Mr Everard Green,
especially in a long and troublesome search which he under-
took in quest of the arms of Cardinal Quignon. They are,
he tells me, as follows: Checky Gules and Vair3 (Quinones)
impaling‚ Party per chevron Gules and Argent, in chief two
castles triple towered Or, in base a lion rampant of the first3 ,
(Henriquez) all within a bordure compony of Castile‚ Leon,
and Portugal-ancient.

I have also to express my thanks to Monsieur Leopold
Delisle3 to the Rev. S. S. Lewis ; and to Mr J. T. Mickle-
thwaite. And I must also add that I have been helped in
preparing this edition by my nephew, Mr R. Wickham
Legg, of New College, Oxford.
