Regz'strmn follows regulae generula, and on the same page

of misprintS.

In this copy sheet C is wanting3 it contained the psalter

Signature title: B. N. except on sheets A and B, when it

Saturday to None of Saturday. From the end of ps, 54 on
p. 15 to the beginning of ps. 127 on p. 18 the reprint has

3. A fragment of an edition is preserved in the National
Library at Paris, as Pz'e‘ce unique. (17667.)

It consists of 8 leaves: Roman type, number of lines
31 or 32. The printed surface is 128><78 or 125><77
mm.

At the top of the first page there is: Breviarium Roma-
num ex sacra Ι potissimum scriptura et proba Ι tis, Sanctorum
Historiis con Ι stans M.D.XXXV. Ι (in black capitals), fol-
lowed immediately underneath by: >Ι< Ad SanctifS. Patrem
et D.N. Paulum ΙΙΙ., and the rest follows as in other
editions, It contains the vt in the first page left out by
P. and also in Thielman Kerver's edition.

The piece ends with the brief of Paul 111. to Antonio
Blado.

At first sight it looks like a fragment of R. but R. does
not repeat the title before the address of the preface: nor is
the sign >Ι< before the addreSS. Nor does the pagination or
lineation correspond.
