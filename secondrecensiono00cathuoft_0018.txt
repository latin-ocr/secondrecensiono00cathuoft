is repeated in all the editions of the first text, and in many of
the second.

The paragraphs printed in Italics are those which in V.
appear printed in red. It has not been found possible to
indicate the capitals which are printed in red ε but as a general
rule it may be said that the first letter of each lesson when ’
not floriated‚ with the first capital letter at the beginning· os -
each psalm and hymn, or verse of psalm and hymn, is red„

In preparing this edition 1 have been under very great
obligations to the late Master of Christ's College, the Rev.
C. A. Swainson, D.D. It is owing to Dr Swainson's exer-

bringing out this edition was entertained by the Syndicate of
the University PreSS. Dr Swainson also undertook to re-

distantly in Mr Blew's footsteps with a desire to throw light
upon one of the sources of our Book of Common Prayer. In
this work, Mr Blew has taken the greatest interest from the
first moment that it was begun. He has been ever ready to
help with his rare knowledge and advice, given without stint ;
and he has ,placed freely at my disposal a library which like
the cap or the purse of the faery story was always ready with
whatever book or edition might be asked for. Besides this,
Mr Blew allowed me the use of his unique edition of the
first text, and to carry it about with me where I chose
beyond the four seas; and it is owing to Mr Blew that a
