PREFA σε. ix

obliterated by black letterS, and there is also an important
tableof errata. V. has felt the influence of the table of errata,
yet in many places it shows signs of an independent revision :'
it brings the directions in the preface as to the sign of the
cross at the beginning of the Hours into harmony with the
rubrics in the Dominz'cale, and it contains several rubrics
which are not found in any of the other editions, The edition
of which a fragment has been preserved at Paris comes next,
following R. as far as it has survived. After these come the
Paris editions, P. seems to have followed the Quarto of
Thielman Kerver (as far as I was able in a few hours to
collate the two editions) evento adopting unusual numbers
for the PsalmS. The Paris printers seem to have followed
the corrections of V. so far as they were mere corrections, and
in the change of the title, but they have not followed V. in
inserting new rubricS. A. in the first part would seem to
follow R„ now and then V. The title and variants of the
preface are those of R„ but after the end of the Psalter the
connexion between P. and A. becomes close. A large number
of the variants of P. are to be found represented in A.

It is hoped that all the more important variations of these

· four editions of the first text will be found in the notes at the

foot of the page. At first it was thought that the second text
might also be presented in this reprint3 but the differences
between the two texts are so great that the attempt was aban-
doned. Though the distribution of the Psalter is the same, yet
the first and third lessons are in many cases different, and the
insertion of antiphons and the dislocation of Saints' days fol-
lowing the introduction of octaveS‚ besides other concessions
to the criticisms of the Sorbonne, render a clear representation
on the same page almost impossible. Added to this, the num-
ber of editions of the second text is very great, probably not
far short of a hundred, and the variations of only a few repre-
sentative editions would have greatly confused the reader.

At the end of the reprint there have been added indices to
the hymnS, collectS, invitatorieS, canticle5‚ and the like. I have
compared these with the hymnS‚ collectS‚ &C.‚ in the Roman
Breviary printed at Venice by Junta in 1534, the year before
the publication of this first text of Quignom and all that I
cannot trace in this older Breviary I have marked in the
